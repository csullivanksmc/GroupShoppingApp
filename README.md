# NeverForget ShoppingList

This app is a shopping list manager which enables users to save individual shopping lists and their respective items. Users can add and delete
items from a list at any time, or edit an item on a list. Similarly, users can delete whole lists at once. 

Beyond development as usual, making this application was a ton of fun because it was my first time working with code in a team setting. 
I was able to learn the basics of using git with a team to manage source. Not only did I get to learn how to use the tool as a team, I was able
to get a sense of how to communicate with my team in order to ensure we were working efficiently (i.e. not both working on the same function/feature) through 
using git and sharing a master repository.
